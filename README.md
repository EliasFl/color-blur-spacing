# Color-Blur-Spacing
This is a little application that changes the background color, blur and spacing of an image with React (and a little of Redux). To see it working, clone or download this repo and in the project folder run these commands:
```
> npm install
> npm start
```
It will pop-up a new window on your favorite browser with the app.
